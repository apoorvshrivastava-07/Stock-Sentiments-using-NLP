VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. VADER sentiment lexicon is sensitive both the polarity and the intensity of sentiments expressed in social media contexts. It gives you a Positive, Negative, Neutral Scores of the sentence. The scoring is a ratio of the proportion for text that falls into each category. 
# Example: This is cool! 
The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 and +1. Compound score is useful for researchers who would like to set standardized thresholds for classifying sentences as either positive, neutral, or negative. 

Using this natural language processing technique, we can understand the emotion behind the news headlines and try to predict the sentiment for multiple stocks.
